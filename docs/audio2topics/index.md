`Audio2Topics` is python packge that automizes topic extraction from voice files. The package is originally designed to aid researchers that performs interview research. Interview research typically incorporates a series of steps, starting from planning research questions, performing interviews, transcribing, and thorough manual text analysis to extract the main themes and topics of the transcribed text. This manual analysis phase is usually long and time-consuming. Additionally, the feasibility of manual analysis is limited by the volume of transcribed data.  `Audio2Topics` accelerating this step by automtically converting voice files of interviews into topics simply and effectively.

The application provides an end-to-end pipeline that handles:
- Audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Topic modeling with multiple algorithms
- Topic validation and optimization
- Advanced visualizations
- Model comparison and evaluation

Audio2Topics bridges the gap between audio content and text analysis, making topic discovery accessible to researchers, content creators, analysts, and anyone who needs to identify key themes in audio materials.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Audio Transcription
- **Issue**: Transcription fails to start
- **Solution**: Check internet connection, try a smaller model size, ensure sufficient disk space

#### Text Processing
- **Issue**: Many stopwords in processed text
- **Solution**: Adjust language setting, add custom stopwords, check preprocessing settings

#### Topic Modeling
- **Issue**: "Dimensionality error" with BERTopic
- **Solution**: Enable adaptive processing, try BERTopic-PCA or NMF instead

#### Validation
- **Issue**: Low coherence scores
- **Solution**: Try different preprocessing, adjust number of topics, try another algorithm

#### Visualization
- **Issue**: Interactive visualization not loading
- **Solution**: Check if the model type matches the visualization type, try a different visualization

### Performance Optimization
- Use smaller Whisper models (base/small) for faster transcription
- Process documents in smaller batches for memory efficiency
- Use GPU acceleration when available
- Save models and results for reuse

## Best Practices

### Audio Recording Quality
- Use clear recordings with minimal background noise
- Ensure adequate volume levels
- Use lossless formats when possible

### Document Preparation
- Split long recordings into shorter segments
- Group related content into meaningful documents
- Remove irrelevant sections before processing

### Topic Modeling Strategy
1. Start with a small subset of documents to test different approaches
2. Use the Comparison tab to identify the best method for your data
3. Validate topic quality before drawing conclusions
4. Use LLM refinement for clearer topic interpretations
5. Combine quantitative metrics with human judgment

### Reporting and Sharing
- Export visualizations in appropriate formats for your audience
- Include topic words and example documents in reports
- Provide context for topics through LLM-generated descriptions
- Use interactive formats (HTML) for detailed exploration
