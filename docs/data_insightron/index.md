`DataInsightron`ðŸ¤– is a Python package designed to provide a comprehensive overview of a dataset characteristics. It computes a variety of metricsâ€”ranging from basic dimensions, Features related metrics, Quality metrics, possible best-performing ML algorithm in prediction tasks, Computational resources requirements, and Complexity measure. `DataInsightron` is desigend to guide you fully undertand your dataset as a whole.
The package is particularly helpful in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, as it automates the extraction of numerous data descriptors that would otherwise be computed through multiple manual steps.

Coming soon! :)
